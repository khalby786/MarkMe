# MarkMe!

Almost a year ago, I made [MarkMe!](https://markme.glitch.me). One of my first projects as someone who was new to coding and web development. The project holds a special place in my heart, especially because of the color scheme, the somewhat cool-looking UI and how well it was recieved by the people of the [Glitch forum](https://support.glitch.com) - a place where I used to spend a lot of time on the web. It was initially me trying to recreate [Liyas Thomas' marcdown](https://github.com/liyasthomas/marcdown) from scratch without looking at marcdown's code, but then I actually started spending time on this "recreated version of marcdown". It's a simple PWA, and although it was initially written with pure JavaScript, I rewrote it in basic Vue after I had learnt the basics of Vue on frontendmasters.com. 

Time flies, and after a while, I felt really discontended with MarkMe!'s functionalities and what it was made with. I noticed that some features I had then implemented didn't work as expected and the UI did not go well with my current design style. That's when I decided to rewrite this project from scratch with Nuxt and this time, I wanted to make sure everything works and had a user-friendly experience, based on user feedback and use cases. 

Some people told me that I shouldn't waste my time redoing this project, and instead I should focus on building new and innovative projects. While I agree with you, I also think that this is a great opportunity for me to learn more about Nuxt, front-end authentication using Firebase and building accessible & better UIs. I think

This project is a **work in progress**, and I'll be building this during my spare time.
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project

```
